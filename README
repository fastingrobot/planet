== What is it?

== Requirements

Currently you need all of those things to get typo to run:

 * Ruby -v of 1.8.2 (25-05-2004) or 1.8.3 
 * Rails 1.0.0 or greater
 * A database.  RailsPlanet supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
 * Ruby drivers for your database.
 * The following gems
     * FeedTools > 0.2.0
     * RedCloth > 3.0.4
 * For best performance, you should have a web server running either
   Apache or Lighttpd along with FastCGI, although these aren't
   strictly required--you can use Ruby's built-in web server for
   low-volume testing.

== Installation

Unpack the tgz or zip in some directory.

Decide which database to use. We support Sqlite, MySQL, and Postgres,
but Sqlite doesn't have full support for database migrations in Rails
0.13.1.

  * Create a database for railsplanet. You can find schemas in the db/ folder. 
  * Create config/database.yml using database.yml.example to reflect your
    newly created database configuration  
  * Create config/config.yml using config.yml.example to reflect the
    configuration needed for you new planet site.
  * Run script/server -e production and see if it works  
  * Point your browser to http://your.domain.com:3000/ and follow the
    install process

== Usage

RailsPlanet admin is located at: http://your.domain.com/admin.  You can use
this for configuration support, adding and deleting feeds, adding and deleting
pages, user creation and deletion.

== Theme Support

Theme support is provided by the theme plugin from Matt McCray.  Themes are
located in the themes directory.  A default theme has been included in this 
installation.  You can create new themes by using the command:

ruby script/generate theme <theme_name>

For more information on using themes please refer to the theme plugin README file at:

http://mattmccray.com/svn/theme_support/trunk/theme_support/README

== Pages

RailsPlanet pages support is provided by using simple Textile markdown.
